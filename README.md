# Simple Recipe API

Challenge to create a simple recipe API


## How to use it
### Requiriments
 - You have to have Ruby version 2.5 installed
 
### Configure recipe API app
- Clone the project
- Inside the project folder execute:
- -  `bundle` command to install dependecies (if you don't have you have
     to install it `gem install bundle`)
- `bundle exec rakeke db:setup` to configure SQLite3 (I'm just using it
  because it's acceptable) and populate with the records from CSV file
provided.

### Test recipe API app
To run the test suit you execute `rspec`. If you want to see the test
coverage open the file `coverage/index.html`

### Run recipe API app-
Execute the command `rails s` to start the application.

#### API Doc
API Errors has the body:
```
{ "error": { "message": "some error message" } }
```
All the command examples assume that the service is running on
`localhost:3000`

  `cuisine=italian` (you can see all cuisine type in the error message
when this field is not present).

the list (the default value is `page=1`)

  value is `limit=30`)

## Web application framework choice
Thee Rails 5 framework was chose because I'm more familiar with it. I've
been working with the framework in the last 5 years. Also it a good tool
to prototype and create web application really fast.
It has advantage to be really configurable, for example, in this project
I choose only to create a API app instead of to create Web app with html
interface.

## How the API would cater for different consumers
By default it should not has any reason for cater different consumers
and different ways. However if it's requirement we could identify
different consumers by user agent and configure default values. For
example, for the resource `GET /v1/recipes` we could define the default
value for the param `limit` as 30 for desktop user agent and 5 for
mobile user agent.
